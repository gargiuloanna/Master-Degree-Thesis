\begin{dedication} 
We are each a patchwork quilt of those who have loved us, \\those who have believed in our futures, \\those who showed us empathy and kindness \\or told us the truth even when it was not easy to hear. 
\\Those who told us we could do it when there was absolutely no proof of that.
